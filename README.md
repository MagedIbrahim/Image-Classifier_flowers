_Image-classifier-flowers_

__Description__

In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice i'd train this classifier, then export it for use in an application. i used a dataset of 102 flower categories.
